PARAGRAPH:

Once you have completed Theory and are in the speed program, you must not forget
the importance of having clean notes. As you work on building speed, you must
also strive for accuracy. You should attend a trail class every day to enforce
good writing habits. You should work on having the fewest number of finger
errors possible. Always remember, speed comes with accuracy.
