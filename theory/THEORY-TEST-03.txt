If you wish to do well in school, it is up to you to put in the hard work. You
should strive to be at the top of your game each day. You should take your
time as you do each exercise of each lesson. Make a promise to practice as
much as you can. You will not find a shortcut to success. Follow the lead of a
successful role model. Remember to work hard, learn all you need to know, and do
not lose sight of your final goal.
