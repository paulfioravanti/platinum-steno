JURY CHARGE:

 Members of the jury, my apologies for not being able to get started with this
 case sooner. In view of the lateness of the hour, I think we ought to send you
 to lunch. When you return from lunch, you'll be in a better mood to listen to
 the evidence. We will then proceed with the case. Please do not discuss the
 case among yourselves. Keep an open mind until you've heard all of the evidence
 in the case. Return here promptly at 2:00 o'clock.
