# Platinum Steno

This repository contains the output of my completion of stenography lessons
created by [Platinum Steno][].

Their lessons can be found on the [Platinum Steno YouTube channel][].

I have only completed what amounts to a small sampling of the exercises, but
the intention is for these files to hopefully be a point of comparison for
anyone else also attempting them.

The lesson PDFs themselves are not included as part of this repository since
they are copyrighted material, but they can all be downloaded for free on a
lesson-by-lesson basis from the Platinum Steno website.

Links to the lesson PDFs can be found in the description of each of the videos
on YouTube.

## Blog Posts

More information about my experiences with Platinum Steno so far can be found
in the following blog posts I wrote:

- _[Going Platinum][]_
- _[Plover For the Record][]_

The latter post goes into detail specifically about Q&A, and how I set up
[Plover][] to be able to format the legal question and answer format in the same
way that Platinum Steno teaches it.

## Q&A Dictionaries

If you are interested in the specific outlines I created to be able to complete
the Q&A exercises, you can find them in the [Q&A dictionary][] of [my steno
dictionaries][].
