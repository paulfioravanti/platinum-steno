habeas corpus, lex, status quo, ante

Habeas corpus deals with persons who may be unjustly detained in custody. A writ
of habeas corpus is the court's formal demand that a person be released from
unjustified detention. Habeas corpus literally means "you have the body". Lex is
a basic root word meaning "the law". Lex, when combined with "con", forms the
word "lexicon", meaning a dictionary of legal terms. "Status quo" means "the way
things are at a given point in time". "Status quo" also refers to the original
position of the existing facts prior to a cause of action. "Ante" is a Latin
word meaning "before". "Antebellum" means "before the war", "antemortem" means
"before death", and "antepartum" means "before childbirth".

Make Peace With Imperfection

I've yet to meet an absolute perfectionist whose life was filled with inner
peace. The need for perfection and the desire for inner tranquility conflict
with each other. Whenever we are attached to having something a certain way
better than it already is, we are almost by definition engaged in a losing
battle. Rather than being content and grateful, we are focused on what's wrong
with something, and our need to fix it. When we are zeroed in on what's wrong,
it implies that we are dissatisfied or discontent. Whether it's related to
ourselves, a disorganised closet, a scratch on the car, an imperfect
accomplishment, a few pounds we would like to lose, or someone else's
imperfections, the way someone looks, behaves, or lives their life, the very act
of focusing on imperfection pulls us away from our goal of being kind and
gentle. This strategy has nothing to do with ceasing to do your very best, but
with being overly attached and focused on what's wrong with life. It's about
realising that while there's always a better way to do something, this doesn't
mean that you can't enjoy and appreciate the way things already are. The
solution here is to catch yourself when you fall into your habit of insisting
that things should be other than they are. Gently remind yourself that life is
okay the way it is right now. In the absence of your judgment, everything would
be fine. As you begin to eliminate your need for perfection in all areas of your
life, you'll begin to discover the perfection in life itself.
