habeas corpus, lex, status quo, ante

Habeas corpus deals with persons who may be unjustly detained in custody. A writ
of habeas corpus is the court's formal demand that a person be released from
unjustified detention. Habeas corpus literally means "you have the body". Lex is
a basic root word meaning "the law". Lex, when combined with "con", forms the
word "lexicon", meaning a dictionary of legal terms. "Status quo" means "the way
things are at a given point in time". "Status quo" also refers to the original
position of the existing facts prior to a cause of action. "Ante" is a Latin
word meaning "before". "Antebellum" means "before the war", "antemortem" means
"before death", and "antepartum" means "before childbirth".
