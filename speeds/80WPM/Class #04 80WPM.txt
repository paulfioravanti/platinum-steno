habeas corpus, lex, status quo, ante

Habeas corpus deals with persons who may be unjustly detained in custody. A writ
of habeas corpus is the court's formal demand that a person be released from
unjustified detention. Habeas corpus literally means "you have the body". Lex is
a basic root word meaning "the law". Lex, when combined with "con", forms the
word "lexicon", meaning a dictionary of legal terms. "Status quo" means "the way
things are at a given point in time". "Status quo" also refers to the original
position of the existing facts prior to a cause of action. "Ante" is a Latin
word meaning "before". "Antebellum" means "before the war", "antemortem" means
"before death", and "antepartum" means "before childbirth".

Make Peace With Imperfection

I've yet to meet an absolute perfectionist whose life was filled with inner
peace. The need for perfection and the desire for inner tranquility conflict
with each other. Whenever we are attached to having something a certain way
better than it already is, we are almost by definition engaged in a losing
battle. Rather than being content and grateful, we are focused on what's wrong
with something, and our need to fix it. When we are zeroed in on what's wrong,
it implies that we are dissatisfied or discontent. Whether it's related to
ourselves, a disorganised closet, a scratch on the car, an imperfect
accomplishment, a few pounds we would like to lose, or someone else's
imperfections, the way someone looks, behaves, or lives their life, the very act
of focusing on imperfection pulls us away from our goal of being kind and
gentle. This strategy has nothing to do with ceasing to do your very best, but
with being overly attached and focused on what's wrong with life. It's about
realising that while there's always a better way to do something, this doesn't
mean that you can't enjoy and appreciate the way things already are. The
solution here is to catch yourself when you fall into your habit of insisting
that things should be other than they are. Gently remind yourself that life is
okay the way it is right now. In the absence of your judgment, everything would
be fine. As you begin to eliminate your need for perfection in all areas of your
life, you'll begin to discover the perfection in life itself.

Let's speak objectively regarding the matter at hand. There are certain matters
which may be considered by the witness informing an opinion as to the fair
market value of the Florence property. When evidence of such matters has been
received, it may be considered only for the very limited and special purpose of
enabling one to understand and weigh the testimony of the witnesses as to their
opinion of the fair market value of the Florence property. Among pertinent
matters which should be considered are the following. First, the area and the
location of the Florence property, the uses for which it may be adapted, it's
proximity to nearby shopping malls and commercial facilities. The accessibility
and the availability of public transportation and the zoning of the Florence
property. Second, the nature of physical improvements on the property, and the
general character of the neighbourhood in the vicinity of the Florence property.
The character of the current uses being made of such other properties, and the
trend for land use and development in the immediate neighbourhood. Third, the
price and important monetary considerations of any sale or contract to sell and
purchase the Florence property, or any other properties which are considered to
be comparable in value to the defendant's property. Generally, the more similar
one property is to another, the closer the value of the one may be expected to
approach the value of the other. Fourth, a witness may also consider the rent,
fees, and charges, or any other terms and circumstances of any lease of the
subject property, or of a property of comparable value. Fifth, a witness may
consider the capitalisation rate of the reasonable net rental value attributable
to the land, and to any existing improvements. Sixth, a witness may also
consider the replacement value as indicated by the value of the land, together
with the cost of replacing, or reproducing the existing improvements thereon,
less any depreciation the improvements have suffered. Seventh, a witness may
also consider the reasonable probability, if any, of a change in zoning
restrictions in the near future, and the effect such a change would have upon
the value of the property. As you have been previously informed, evidence should
be considered only for the purpose of enabling one to understand and weigh the
testimony of the witnesses as to their opinions of market value.

Heroes for Today
Every town and city in America has its own example of courage, kindness, and
decency. Here are three.
The trouble started at 9:30 p.m. last New Year's Eve in Newark, New Jersey when
Engine 5 arrived at the fire, and an elderly woman was sitting in a third floor
window, leaning out. Firefighters braced a ladder against the wooden tenement
and 26 year old Marcus Reddick climbed 35 feet to the third floor. Marcus was so
nimble, he would slide down the fire station pole upside down. Sabrina Yubeta,
68 and stocky, was sitting with both feet out of the window. When Marcus reached
the top, the hysterical woman wrapped her legs around him. Seeing that Marcus
was having difficulty, another firefighter climbed up to help. For several
seconds he held Marcus's legs while Marcus held Sabrina. It was a fragile
balance. Suddenly, Marcus fell backward off the ladder, with the large woman
sitting on him. Marcus landed first, hitting a concrete wall beside the front
stairs and broke the woman's fall. She fell no more, but he bounced another ten
feet down the basement stairs. When the fire chief reached him, Marcus was
unconscious, bleeding from his ears. Within an hour, a paramedic told the men
that Marcus was nearly brain-dead and would only get worse. Doctors talked of
turning off life support equipment, and asked if the family wanted to donate his
organs. The answer was "yes". On January 6, firefighters lifted Marcus's coffin,
draped in an American flag, on to a red fire engine. Hundreds of firefighters
from all over the state joined the procession through Newark streets. Children
watched from school windows. As the coffin passed a fire house, the crew on duty
saluted. At church, the reading was about the just man who dieth early. The day
Marcus died, his heart was donated to Carlos Torres, age 45, who had been
steadily deteriorating. Officials said it was the life, or second life Marcus
had saved that week.

The School that Pride Built
The Hickory Flats school, with 360 students, is in one of the smallest and
poorest school districts in Mississippi. Since the mid-1960s, the district had
housed its elementary classes in four run down trailers, with sagging floors,
leaky roofs, and doors that would not close in winter. The 500 people who live
in Hickory Flat spent six years looking for money to build a new school. State
and federal officials told them there was no money. Three times in the late
1990s the district asked voters to float a bond issue to pay for the
construction. The proposal passed inside the school district boundaries, but was
defeated elsewhere in the county. So, over two years, residents started raising
money: raised $965,000 by soliciting donations, and putting on fish fries,
hamburger dinners, and auctions. An additional $75,000 came from property that
the county school board sold in order to contribute to the project. Except for
the concrete and cinderblock work, the labour was done by volunteers on weekends
and at night. They finished the one-storey, ten-room building in August 2014,
the day before classes were to start, says former PTA president, Jimmy Gresham.
The night we finally finished waxing the floors, I was riding home in my
pick-up. I couldn't help but give out a big yell, and thank God for pulling us
through. I don't know if other communities can do the same thing, but I sure
recommend it. This building has made everyone in Hickory Flat mighty proud.

Farewell to Welfare
Every time Jessica Williams drove the roads near her Orange County, California
home, she got wrinkled. In the orange groves, fresh fruit had fallen of the
trees, literally blanketed the ground. It was the same in other fields:
tomatoes, cauliflower, avocados, and other fruits and vegetables, had been left
to rot, eventually to be tilled back into the soil. "Any kind of waste has
always upset me", confesses the energetic 38-year-old mother of three. "To have
all this food go to waste while we're paying taxes to buy food stamps for hungry
people really bothers me". So, Jessica decided to do something about that. In
March 2014, she incorporated Sunshine Outreach, thought to be the first ever
Gleaming operation in Orange County. A week later, she directed the first group
of volunteers, made up of both the unemployed and professional business people,
in retrieving discarded produce from local farms. "Orange County is usually
considered affluent", Judy says, "but there are thousands of homeless people in
the county, and lots of others on welfare and food stamps". In fact, 15 years
before, the Williams' had been part of those statistics when both Jessica and
her husband lost their jobs. Jessica knows what it feels like to be on welfare
and then finally find a path back to a productive life. One such path is
Gleaming. "Many people on welfare with no job get depressed," says Jessica,
"they have no feeling of self-worth. But when they go out to the fields, glean
for a while, and can fill up the back of a truck with oranges, they really have
a feeling of accomplishment. In just a few hours, 10 people can collect 4000
pounds of produce. The workers take what they need, or trade it in for canned
goods and staples at area food banks." Jessica recalls one welfare recipient who
said, as she loaded her car with food, "I feel so much better about life, having
earned this instead of just getting a hand out". When she began Sunshine
Outreach, Jessica set a goal of turning around 25 needy families in the first
year. The number of families saying farewell to welfare has far exceeded that,
she says. In fact, the project has retrieved so much food, that it helps funnel
produce and other donated food to more than 30 agencies that serve the needy.
