The coliseum collapsed.
What colour is the Collie?
My colleagues are in collusion.
Requiring collateral is common.
This is too complex to comprehend.
This construction was condemned.
Be concise and consistent.

Sales Warranty
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, the burden of proof rests upon the defendant
to prove by the greater weight of the evidence that the property in question was
in a damaged condition as claimed by him when the property was delivered to him,
at which the title passed from the plaintiff to the defendant. Any damage, of
course, after such delivery, which was not due to any negligence or fault on the
part of the plaintiff, could not be charged to the plaintiff. Upon a breach of
warranty on the sale of personal property, the buyer has the right to recover
for all damages, which in the contemplation of the parties, or according to the
natural or usual course of things, may result from said such breach. The
ordinary measure of damages is the difference between the actual value of the
goods sold, and what would have been their value if they had been as warranted.

Great Things Never Came From Comfort Zones
Not every obstacle is about a regular habit, however, and a change in tactics
may be called for when approaching that kind of obstacle. Perhaps the problem is
finding a support group such as Train. Brainstorm other ways to connect with a
like-minded group. For instance, through social media such as the Train group on
Facebook, or another court reporting group that offers help with realtime
questions. Another possible is to use the material on NCRA's Train web page to
create a group that is more local or more focused on a particular issue. Another
possible would be to reach out to a vendor or state association to see if
additional training would help, or review relevant materials through an online
resource. As a final suggestion, make sure to review goals and deadlines on a
regular basis. Progress towards a goal may be slow at first, but patience and
determination characteristics inherent in many court reporters, captioners, and
others associated with the profession, will go a long way to making goals
reality. Don't be afraid to fail; be afraid not to try.

Sales Warranty
In this case, the defendant claims to have sustained such damages because of
certain losses sustained by reason of plaintiff's breach of warranty, and in
this claim is included profits or gains which he would have realised from the
chickens purchased, had they been in the condition as represented. He claims
that because of his losses, and the death of these chickens, such profits were
denied him. It is a law that where reasonable profits or gains are prevented and
losses sustained because of a breach of warranty, and where the losses may be
determined with reasonable certainty from the evidence, then such contemplated
profits may be recovered by the buyer. However, such damages can be recovered
only when capable of being ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty,
and when such contemplated profits are within the contemplation of the parties
as a result of the breach of warranty.

Who Moved My Cheese
Now he felt the cool breeze that was blowing in this part of the maze, and it
was refreshing. He took in some deep breaths, and felt invigorated by the
movement. Once he had gotten past his fear, it turned out to be more
enjoyable than he once believed it could be. Haw hadn't felt this way for a long
time. He had almost forgotten how much fun it was. To make things even better,
Haw started to paint a picture in his mind. He saw himself in great realistic
detail, sitting in the middle of a pile of all his favourite cheeses, from
cheddar to brie. He saw himself eating the many cheeses he liked, and he enjoyed
what he saw. Then, he imagined how much he would enjoy all their great tastes.
The more clearly he saw the image of new cheese, the more real it became, and
the more he could sense that he was going to find it. He wrote "imagining myself
enjoying new cheese even before I find it leads me to it".

Arson
Ladies and gentlemen, the plaintiff in this case is charged by the defendant
with having committed a criminal act: the act of arson. In a case of this kind,
the presumption of innocence exists, and the probability that one will commit a
crime is an element here involved, which should be considered by you with all
the other evidence in the case. After viewing the whole case with such
carefulness as the gravity of the subject demands, the issue should be
determined in accordance with the preponderance of the proof. A fraud is never
presumed, and must be proved. If a fire is seen to break out in two or more
places, at about the same time, at points distant from each other, it is for you
to say whether or not those fires were started by human agency, or whether it
was an accident or misfortune that started them. That is a question of fact for
you to determine.

Who Moved My Cheese
Why didn't I do this before, Haw asked himself. Then he raced through the maze
with greater strength and agility. Before long, he spotted a cheese station, and
became excited as he noticed little pieces of new cheese near the entrance. They
were types of cheeses he had never seen before, but they looked great. He tried
them, and found that they were delicious. He ate most of the new cheese bits
that were available, and put a few in his pocket to have later, and perhaps
share with Hem. He began to regain his strength.
