Who Moved My Cheese
Later, as Haw looked back on things, he realised that the cheese at Cheese
Station C had not just disappeared overnight, as he had once thought. The amount
of cheese that had been there toward the end had been getting smaller, and what
was left had grown old. It didn't taste as good. Mold may even have begun to
grow on the old cheese, although he hadn't noticed it. He had to admit, however,
that if he had wanted to, he probably could have seen what was coming. But, he
didn't. Haw now realised that the change probably would not have taken him by
surprise if he had been watching what was happening all along, and if he had
anticipated change. Maybe that's what Sniff and Scurry had been doing. He
stopped for a rest, and wrote on the wall of the maze: "Smell the cheese often,
so you know when it is getting old". Sometime later, after not finding cheese
for what seemed like a long time, Haw finally came across a huge cheese station
which looked promising. When he went inside, however, he was most disappointed
to discover that the cheese station was empty.

The rest of the complaint sought to hold the defendant liable based solely on an
alleged association with certain organisations. The complaint alleges that the
defendant provided material support to the violent organisation.
