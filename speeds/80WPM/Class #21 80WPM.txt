Who Moved My Cheese
Later, as Haw looked back on things, he realised that the cheese at Cheese
Station C had not just disappeared overnight, as he had once thought. The amount
of cheese that had been there toward the end had been getting smaller, and what
was left had grown old. It didn't taste as good. Mold may even have begun to
grow on the old cheese, although he hadn't noticed it. He had to admit, however,
that if he had wanted to, he probably could have seen what was coming. But, he
didn't. Haw now realised that the change probably would not have taken him by
surprise if he had been watching what was happening all along, and if he had
anticipated change. Maybe that's what Sniff and Scurry had been doing. He
stopped for a rest, and wrote on the wall of the maze: "Smell the cheese often,
so you know when it is getting old". Sometime later, after not finding cheese
for what seemed like a long time, Haw finally came across a huge cheese station
which looked promising. When he went inside, however, he was most disappointed
to discover that the cheese station was empty.

complaint, allege, alleged, alleges, illegal, affidavit
The rest of the complaint sought to hold the defendant liable based solely on an
alleged association with certain organisations. The complaint alleges that the
defendant provided material support to the violent organisation. The material
support that the defendant is supposed to have provided is defined as the person
of the defendant. In other words, the complaint is alleged that by participating
in the activity, the defendant was supplying material support in the form of his
person. He was the material support that is alleged in the complaint. The
complaint alleges that the defendant provide himself as material support. The
defense noted that the complaint quoted parts of an interview with the defendant
conducted after he was taken into custody. He said that the affidavit failed to
state that the defendant did not see anything that went on. The complaint seeks
to hold the defendant liable based on the alleged association with concern
organisations. It is necessary for the individual to possess interest to further
illegal aims. The defense holds that there is no evidence, nor does the
affidavit allege that the defendant ever took part in any conduct by the named
organisation. The defense goes on to say that there is no evidence that the
defendant had any intent to further any illegal objectives of those
organisations. In fact, the affidavit alleges the defendant did not train, nor
did he take part in any illegal conduct. With this in mind, he said that there
is no probable cause to find that the defendant violated the statutes under
which he is charged.

Sometime later, after not finding cheese for what seemed like a long time, Haw
finally came across a huge cheese station that looked promising. When he went
inside, however, he was most disappointed to discover that the cheese station
was empty. "This empty feeling has happened to me too often", he thought. He
felt like giving up. Haw losing his physical strength. He knew he was lost, and
was afraid he would not survive. He thought about turning around and heading
back to Cheese Station C. At least if he made it back, and Hem was still there,
Haw wouldn't be alone. Then, he asked himself the same question again: what
would I do if I weren't afraid? He was afraid more often than he liked to admit,
even to himself. He wasn't always sure what he was afraid of, but in his
weakened condition, he knew now he was simply fearful of going on alone. Haw
didn't know it, but he was running behind because he was weighed down by fearful
beliefs.

He is charged with certain violations of statutes. In other words, he did not
participate in any conspiracy. He did not commit any crime against the people of
the United States. The defense also alleges that the alleged statements by the
defendant were made under highly coercive circumstances. Because the alleged
statements were made under these circumstances, the statements are inadmissible.
He indicated that the defendant had been injured during this period. The defense
also indicated that the defendant has no criminal record of any kind. He had no
record of any drug use. He was taken into custody without being given his
rights. Since the defendant has no criminal record, the defense asked that the
defendant be released either under his own recognizance, or not. The attorney
for the defense argued that there was no probable cause to find that the
defendant violated the statutes under which he is charged. He also said that the
term "personnel", as used in a particular code section was vague. They said that
it violated the constitution. A proffer was used to allege that the defendant
was coerced into his statements, and corroborated in part by press reports. A
proffer is an offer of evidence. The attorney used a proffer to allege that he
was coerced into his statements. The defendant's parents offered to pledge that
the defendant would attend all court sessions. The court has the discretion in
granting this request. The court makes the decision of whether the defendant is
to be allowed to be released on his own recognizance.

Haw wondered if Hem had moved on, or if he was still paralyzed by his fears.
Then, Haw remembered the times when he had felt his best in the maze. It was
when he was moving along. He wrote on the wall, knowing it was as much of a
reminder to himself as it was a marking for his buddy Hem hopefully to follow.
Movement in a new direction helps you find new cheese. Haw looked down the dark
passageway, and was aware of his fear. What lay ahead? Was it empty, or worse,
were there dangers lurking? He began to imagine all kinds of frightening things
that could happen to him. He was scaring himself to death.

BY MR. EUFPLT:
	Q	You have talked about people being in the street, around the bank, and
north of the bank, and around the bonfire. Were there any people wandering
around south of the bank?
	A	As far as I know, there were just people walking around the bank all
night long.
	Q	You have testified that you didn't know any of the people who were
throwing rocks?
	A	That's true.
	Q	Aside from that, roughly how many people did you encounter that evening
that you knew?
	A	Oh, approximately 15, I think. I am not sure.
	Q	And you talked to them?
	A	Yes. I did.
	Q	And they were sort of wandering around as you were?
	A	Yes. They were.
	Q	Among the 15 or so that you say you knew, did any of them throw any
rocks?
	A	I didn't see them throwing any rocks.
