negligence, reasonably, circumstances, exercised, proximate cause,
preponderance, preponderance of the evidence

Negligence is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent person would not
do, or the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person would do
under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence. You must consider
the circumstances. You must consider the proximate cause. You must determine
whether the defendant exercised due care under the circumstances, similar to
those in this case. The circumstances that you must consider are similar
circumstances. Ordinary or reasonable care is that care that persons of ordinary
prudence would use in order to avoid injury to themselves or others under
circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence.

Who Moved My Cheese?
The situation hadn't changed. The cheese was no longer there. The little people
didn't know what to do. Hem and Haw just stood there, immobilised, like two
statues. Haw shut his eyes as tight as he could, and put his hands over his
ears. He just wanted to block everything out. He didn't want to know the cheese
supply had gradually been getting smaller. He believed it had been moved all of
a sudden. Hem analysed the situation over and over, and soon his complicated
brain, with its huge belief system, took hold. "Why did they do this to me?", he
demanded. "What's really going on here?". Finally, Haw opened his eyes, looked
around, and said "by the way, where are Sniff and Scurry? Do you think they know
something we don't?". Hem said "what would they know?". Hem continued, "they're
just simple mice. They just respond to what happens. We're little people. We're
special. We should be able to figure this out, and besides, we deserve better.
This should not happen to us, or if it does, we should at least get some
benefits". "Why should we get benefits?", Haw asked. "Because we're entitled",
Hem said. "Entitled to what?", Haw wanted to know. "We're entitled to our
cheese". "Why?", Haw asked. "Because we didn't cause this problem", Hem said,
"somebody else did this, and we should get something out of it". Haw suggested
"maybe we should stop analysing the situation so much, and just get going and
find some new cheese". "Oh no", Hem said, "I'm going to get to the bottom of
this". While Hem and Haw were still trying to decide what to do, Sniff and
Scurry were already well on their way. They went further into the maze, up and
down halls, looking for cheese in every cheese station they could find. They
didn't think of anything else but finding new cheese.

district attorney, burden of proof, reasonable doubt, knowingly and willingly

It is the duty of the district attorney to prove her case. The burden of proof
is on the people to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. You have been presented with evidence by the district attorney. The
district attorney must prove that the defendants knowingly and willingly
committed the crime. It is now your duty to determine the effect and value of
the evidence, and to decide all questions of fact. What I mean by that is that
you have the duty to determine whether the evidence is such that it proves
the case beyond all reasonable doubt. It is the responsibility of the district
attorney to show that the defendant knowingly and willingly committed the crime.
It is the responsibility of the district attorney to prove this beyond a
reasonable doubt. You must not look to the defendant's counsel to see whether he
proved that the defendant is not guilty. Rather, you must look to see if the
district attorney was able to prove the case that he set forth in his opening
statement. Keep in mind that the statements of counsel are not evidence, unless
counsel have stipulated to a fact that is an important consideration. After the
bailiff leads you into a room in which you will make your decision, you may not
leave that room without the bailiff. If you have any questions to ask of me, the
bailiff will give them to me in my chambers. You must not look to any sources
for evidence. You must not speculate as to the guilt of the party. You may not
speculate as to the answers to questions which objections were sustained, or as
to the reasons for the objections. You may not consider any evidence that
was stricken.

If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did this crime
with the intent to cause another person to pay money in order to obtain the
release of the child, you should answer this question "yes". If you are not so
sure, you must answer this question "no". As far as the witnesses are concerned,
the general rule is that a person may testify only to facts that he or she
knows. However, a person who has knowledge or education in a certain field may
be allowed to give an opinion as an expert in that field. In deciding how much
weight you will give to this opinion, you should decide if this person has the
knowledge, and if the opinion is based on facts established, or facts agreed. I
have allowed such evidence in this case to aid you in reaching a conclusion if
it does aid you. You must remember, however, that you are not bound by the
opinions of the expert.
