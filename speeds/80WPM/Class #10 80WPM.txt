Highway Traffic Act
It definitely appears that both motorists were driving at a speed lower than the
maximum permitted under the Highway Traffic Act, but the fact that the speed of
a vehicle is less than permitted by law does not relieve the driver from the
responsibility of reducing speed when special hazards exist with respect to
weather visibility or highway conditions. It was the duty of each of these
drivers to keep his vehicle in his own lane of the pavement. This collision
could not have happened if each had done his duty in that respect. It is for you
jurors, as judges of the facts, to determine where and how this accident
happened, and who was to blame. Whether both drivers were guilty of negligence,
which substantially contributed to cause the accident, or if weather conditions
alone were responsible. Should you find that both drivers were guilty of
violation, and the violation by each was an approximate cause of the accident,
then neither party can avoid liability.

The same reporter wrote to me recently. Thanks for my buck up speech, each time
I needed that to focus. It really wasn't as bad as I tried to make it out each
time. Now, what should I work toward? I can tell this court reporter likes
having a full plate. One student wrote "I am writing cleaner. I feel a pass
coming soon. I shouldn't be focusing on what other -- everyone else is doing,
right? It's all about me, right?" The student passed her two certifying tests
that week. Another student said "wow, you sure took the saddle off that
elephant, and I now have to choose a better path". I replied "perhaps you do not
want to swan dive into the mind games. Simply focus on your strengths, and
improve your weaknesses".

Contributory Negligence
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, contributory negligence is a want of ordinary
or reasonable care on the part of the person injuried by the negligence of
another, directly contributing to the injury as a proximate cause thereof.
Contributory negligence may also be defined as a failure on the part of a person
injured by the negligence of another to exercise ordinary or reasonable care to
avoid the injury. One cannot recover damages for an injury to the commission of
which he has directly contributed. If the passenger is at fault, whether because
of doing something he should not have done, or in failing to do something he
should have done, then he cannot recover damages for injuries he has sustained.
If the passenger's negligence has been a proximate cause of his injuries, he
cannot recover from another who has also been negligent.

New opportunities can begin with small steps. We can each evolve to a better
place when we choose opportunities or when we are given ultimatums. Perhaps
there has never been a better time to expand your skills, or perhaps you believe
there has to be a secret sauce to reaching your goal, your desired result. Yet,
you know that once you reach your goal, your tenacity will instantly focus on
the creation of the next hurdle. We often use that word, and on to the next
challenge. We are not individuals that rest on our laurels. Based on my many
years of teaching, and coaching, I can say that the normal state of a court
reporter's or court reporting student's mind is setting goals and expanding his
or her skills. Why am I writing about this now? I want you to know that you are
not alone. Attorneys are requesting more and expecting more. Consumers want
more, too. The awareness of unprecedented access to an instant record from court
reporters, captioners, and CART providers, has changed our profession.

Who Moved My Cheese
Now he felt that it was just a question of time before he found what he needed.
In fact, he sensed he had already found what he was looking for. He smiled as he
realised it is safer to search in the maze than remain in a cheese-less
situation. Haw realised again, as he had once before, that what you are afraid
of is never as bad as what you imagine. The fear you let build up in your mind
is worse than the situation that actually exists. He'd been so afraid of never
finding new cheese, that he didn't even want to start looking. But, since
starting his journey, he had found enough cheese in the halls to keep him going.
Now, he looked forward to finding more. Just looking ahead was becoming
exciting.

Contributory Negligence
But before you can find that the plaintiff is barred from recovery because of
his own contributory negligence, you must find that his negligence was a
substantial factor which, together with the defendant's negligence, proximately
caused the accident. If the plaintiff, in the exercise of ordinary care, under
the circumstances, should have been aware either that the defendant was
unmindful of some danger, known or apparent to the plaintiff, or that the
defendant was not taking proper precaution in the operation of the car, and the
plaintiff failed to admonish the driver, or failed to take proper steps for his
own safety. And, if such failure to admonish the driver was a substantial factor
in proximately causing the accident, then the plaintiff cannot recover, even
though the driver was negligent. But, if you find from the evidence that, as the
car in which the plaintiff was riding, approached the place of the accident, the
plaintiff exercised the care that a person of ordinary prudence and care would
have exercised under the same circumstances with regard to admonishing the
driver, then the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence.
