The third element of this type of crime requires that one or both men did
perform an act to effect the object of the conspiracy. Such an act must be more
than mere planning. If there was any action which was a step toward
accomplishing the criminal goal, that is sufficient. If you are sure beyond a
reasonable doubt that Bart Bell intended to kidnap the child, that he was part
of a conspiracy to commit that crime, and that one or more men did do something
to contribute to the commission of it, you should find the defendant guilty of
being a partner to the crime. If you are not so satisfied, you must find him not
guilty. As I said to you before, the offense of kidnapping, as that term applies
to this case, is committed by one who uses deceit to induce a child to go from
one location to another, and who does so with intent to cause her to be secretly
confined. Before you may find the defendant guilty of this crime, you must be
sure that the prosecution has proved the following three elements, and that it
has done so by evidence that satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt. First,
that either Bart Bell, or someone else, induced the child to go from one place
to another. Second, that either Bart Bell, or the other person, used deceit to
induce the child to go from one place to another. Third, that either Bart Bell,
or the other person, induced the child to go from one location to another with
the intention that the child would be confined.

Who Moved My Cheese?
As time went on, Sniff and Scurry continued their routine. They arrived each
morning and sniffed and scratched and scurried around Cheese Station C,
inspecting the area to see if there had been any changes from the day before.
Then, they would sit down to nibble on the cheese. One morning, they arrived at
Cheese Station C, and discovered there was no cheese. They weren't
surprised since Sniff and Scurry had noticed the supply of cheese had been
getting smaller every day. They were prepared for the inevitable, and knew
exactly what to do. They looked at each other, removed the running shoes they
had tied together, and hung conveniently around their necks, put them on their
feet, and laced them up. The mice did not overanalyse things, and they were not
burdened with many hard beliefs. To the mice, the problem and the answer were
both simple. The situation at Cheese Station C had changed. So, Sniff and Scurry
decided to change. They both looked out into the maze. Then, Sniff lifted his
nose, sniffed, and nodded to Scurry, who took off running through the maze,
while Sniff followed as fast as he could. They were quickly off in search of new
cheese. Later that same day, Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C. They had
not been paying attention to the small changes that had been taking place each
day. So, they took it for granted that their cheese would be there. They were
unprepared for what they found. "What, no cheese?!", Hem yelled. He continued
yelling "no cheese, no cheese!", as though if he shouted loud enough, someone
would put it back. "Who moved my cheese?!", he hollered. Finally, he put his
hands on his hips, his face turned red, and he screamed at the top of his voice.
"It's not fair!"

The duty of the jury is to determine whether the plaintiff should be able to
recover all or part of the damages resulting from the plaintiff's part. As
indicated, the defendant has admitted liability for a portion of the injury.
Whether the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the liability of the
defendant is not the only issue to be decided. What may be decided is whether
these damages resulted from the defendant being the proximate cause of the
accident. As a juror, you must decide the issue of proximate cause. The
proximate cause is the immediate cause. While the defendant may be a part of the
cause, they defendant may not be the proximate cause. There is a difference when
the defendant admitted liability for the accident, the defendant did not admit
liability for being the proximate cause of the accident. A plaintiff who is
injured as a proximate or legal result of some negligent conduct on the part of
the defendant is entitled to recover for such injury from that defendant. The
question for you is to determine whether this fits this case in question. You
must examine whether the conduct of the defendant was negligent. You must also
examine whether this negligent conduct was the only conduct that caused the
accident.

If it was the only negligent conduct, then you must consider this in your
decision. With regard to liability, you must determine the proximate cause of
the accident. You must know that negligence must also be considered on the part
of the plaintiff. You must examine whether the conduct of this individual was in
any way responsible for what happened. You must examine the conduct of the truck
driver as well. A plaintiff who was injured as a proximate or legal result of
such negligent conduct on the part of a defendant is entitled to recover from
that injury from that defendant. The amount must be decided. The plaintiff is
entitled to a verdict in this case if you find that the defendant was negligent,
and that such negligence was a proximate or legal cause of injury to the
plaintiff, you must determine whether the driver of the truck could have been
the proximate cause. For this reason, you must know and understand the meaning
of "negligence".
