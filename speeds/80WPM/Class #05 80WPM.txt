Members of the jury, in the course of the proceedings before you, I shall, from
time to time, instruct you in the law pertaining to this case. It shall be your
duty to follow the law. You must, further, determine from the evidence, the
facts of the case, being judicious in your discrimination between fact and
allegation. Facts are limited to items of testimony admitted as evidence, or
stipulated by counsel. On other than direct testimony, counsel will say "so
stipulated". Allegations by counsel or litigants, inferences from questions,
hearsay, and all testimony stricken from the record, must be ignored as if they
had never occurred. If counsel objects to a question, and the objection is
sustained, you must not conjecture as to the probable answer to the question. On
the other hand, any objection to a question which is overruled by me is to be
treated as though there had been no objection, and the question is admissible.

Don't Sweat the Small Stuff
Often we allow ourselves to get all worked up about things that upon closer
examination aren't really that big a deal. We focus on little problems and
concerns, and blow them way out of proportion. A stranger, for example, might
cut in front of us in traffic. Rather than let it go, and go on with our day, we
convince ourselves that we are justified in our anger. We play out an imaginary
confrontation in our mind. Many of us might even tell someone else about the
incident later on, rather simply let it go. Why not instead simply allow the
driver to have his accident somewhere else? Try to have compassion for the
person and remember how painful it is to be in such an enormous hurry. This way,
we can maintain our own sense of well being, and avoid taking other people's
problems personally. There are many similar small stuff examples that occur
every day in our lives, whether we had to wait in line, listen to unfair
criticism, or do the lion's share of the work, it pays enormous dividends if we
learn not to worry about the little things. So many people spend so much of
their life energy sweating the small stuff, that they completely lose touch with
the magic and beauty of life. When you commit to working toward this goal, you
will find that you will have far more energy to be kinder and gentler.

Giant Jupiter -- See it in September
Tonight, if the sky is clear, you can see Jupiter, the biggest planet in the
solar system. You can watch it rise, and, if you have binoculars, you can see
four of its moons. You don't need a telescope to do all this, and you don't need
to be an expert. From Earth, Jupiter looks like a star. But, it isn't really.
Stars shine because they are hot, and make their own light. Like all of the
sun's planets, Jupiter shines simply because it reflects sunlight that is
falling on to it. Jupiter circles the sun, just as Earth does, but Jupiter is
much farther away. Earth is 93 million miles from the sun. Jupiter is 484
million miles from the sun. Because Jupiter is so far away, it takes 12 of
Earth's years to complete one orbit. Despite its great distance, Jupiter is very
bright. It looks brighter than any star, and it normally outshines every other
planet except Venus. Sometimes Mars is also brighter than Jupiter, but usually
it isn't. Jupiter is so bright because it is so big. It is 88,800 miles
across: 11 times wider than Earth. A planet that size reflects a lot of
sunlight. Seeing Jupiter is easy: on a clear night this September, go outside
two hours after sunset. Face east, the direction opposite where the sun sets.
Look at the entire eastern sky, and find the brightest star you can see. That
bright object is Jupiter. Jupiter will rise, and you can watch it do so. Make a
note of where Jupiter is at first, then come back in an hour. You'll see that
Jupiter is higher in the eastern sky. If you were to watch the planet all night,
you would see it continue to rise until it reached its high point. Then, it
would drop slowly down the western sky, and set in the west. Jupiter and the
other planets rise and set for the same reason the sun does: because the Earth
is turning. These objects appear to go around us. Now it's time for a greater
challenge. The four big moons of Jupiter. You can see them if you have
binoculars. Jupiter has sixteen known moons that go around it the way the moon
orbits Earth. Four of these moons are big, and they are easy to see with
binoculars. The other twelve are much smaller, and you would need a telescope to
see them. First, focus the binoculars by pointing them at any star and adjusting
the focus so that the star looks like a point. Then, hold the binoculars steady,
prop them up against a tree or fence, and point them at Jupiter. You should see
three or four tiny points of light lined up beside Jupiter. These points of
light are its large moons. Some of the moons might be on one side of the planet,
while others might be on the other side. And once during every orbit each moon
passes in front of, and behind, Jupiter. At those times, you can't see the moon
at all. That's why you might not see all four moons. Italian astronomer Galileo
Galilei discovered the four moons in 1610 when he pointed a small telescope at
Jupiter. Sometimes, the four moons are called the Galilean moons in his honour.
The moons names are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Several spacecraft have
sent back pictures of Jupiter and its moons. One of these spacecraft,
appropriately named Galileo, has gone into orbit around the planet. So, now we
know what the Galilean moons look like. Io is red and orange and yellow.
Ganymedes is grey, and Callisto is black. You won't be able to tell this through
binoculars, since all you'll see is tiny points of light. Jupiter's moons are
fun to watch. Each night they're in different places because they move around
Jupiter much faster than our moon moves around Earth. Our moon takes about a
month to go around Earth. But Io, the fastest of Jupiter's four big moons,
circles the planet in just one day and 18 hours. Even the slowest, Callisto,
completes an orbit in just half a month. Each night you can observe the moons
through binoculars, and write down where the moons are. Even if you don't want
to follow the motions of Jupiter's moons night after night, think what you've
done tonight. You've seen the biggest planet in the solar system, plus four of
its moons, all without a telescope. Not bad for a night's work.

A mensa et thoro, writ of certiorari, ex post facto, in limine

A mensa et thoro means a legal separation separation. Several states, including
California, use the term "separate maintenance" rather than "a mensa et thoro".
A writ of certiorari is an order requiring a review or inquiry, and is exercised
in an appellate proceeding. Certiorari is often shortened to "cert". Ex post
facto means "after the fact". An ex post facto law is a doctrine that makes an
act a crime after the act has been performed. A mensa et thoro means "from bed
and board". Ex post facto laws are generally prohibited by the constitution. In
limine means "on the threshold" or "about to happen", a motion made at the
outset of a trial is a motion in limine.

Mr. President, as this year has drawn to a close, what we have been taking, or
what has been taking place in eastern Europe is nothing short of a miracle. The
free world has stood by in utter amazement while one man, Mr. Gorbachev, has
been at the helm of a transformation that has taken people everywhere by
surprise. We have seen the Cold War peacefully deconstruct. We have seen the
Berlin Wall come tumbling down. We have seen the Iron Curtain crumble. Gorbachev
was president of the soviets, and a powerful leader. In some accounts, he is
regarded as a hero for challenging ideology that has been around since the time
of Stalin. By others, he is regarded as dangerous because he was questioning the
philosophy of communism. With remarkable imagination, Yeltsin has embarked on an
irreversible and daring course. He is attempting to transform an inherently
destructive governmental system. He is trying to bring down the old regime, and
make way for a new Soviet Union. Even a new Europe. We as Americans must
question his goals. Is he working toward a free Europe and a free international
market? The radical changes he has instigated during the last two years include
the right to free expression and free speech. He is attempting to restructure
his own country. To do away with suppression. To do away with threats. To do
away with stagnation. And to do away with forced labour. The effects of this
revolutionary way of thinking have been felt in Hungary, Germany, Poland, and
China. He has inaugurated these changes in his own country without bloodshed.
Mr. President, Yeltsin is to be heralded as a breath of fresh air. I highly
recommend that we wholeheartedly endorse and support him.
