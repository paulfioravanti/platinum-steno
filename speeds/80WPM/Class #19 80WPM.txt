The Comeback Kid
It is 8:30 a.m. a week before graduation, and John, still half asleep, swings
his legs out of bed. On his arms are the supportive splints he wears, even when
he sleeps. "I toss and turn a lot", he explains, "I feel better with my arms
protected". Preparing breakfast in the kitchen, his mother Karen hears John
moving, and is already halfway down the hall when he calls out. It's a reality
John prefers not to dwell on. But, he is absolutely dependent on his mother's
care. Using the strength in his shoulders, John can lift both arms over his
head. He has no useful elbow movement, however, and no hand or wrist control.
Dr. van Beek is hopeful that John will regain feeling in his hands within two
years, but it may well take five years, and several more operations, as well as
intensive therapy, before anyone can know the extent to which John will be able
to move and control his hands. One of van Beek's goals now is to increase John's
elbow movement, but that, too, will require surgery, and long hours of therapy.
In the bathroom next to John's room, Karen attaches a strap just above the wrist
of his left splint. Then, she slides in a hook that John uses to pull his boxer
shorts up and down. A few minutes later, John calls "Mom" again, and within
seconds, Karen is undoing the hook, and replacing it with a second contraption
that holds John's toothbrush. She squeezes on a dab of toothpaste, and closes
the door behind her. "He doesn't like people to watch", says Karen, "I guess I
don't blame him". Privacy, these days, is a rarity for John. He has become
something of a public figure. At a welcome home pot luck dinner held in early
March, days after he returned from the hospital, the tired, weak, teenager took
time to chat with nearly each of the 300 friends and neighbours who packed the
Hurstfield Community Center. "I'm doing great", he repeated between mouthfuls of
baked beans and Jell-o. He has met scores of celebrities, who have visited him
in the hospital. And even had offers to audition as a singer, which is his
lifelong dream, from two recording studios. Says John, "I've never been treated
better", and yet, at times, he tires of the spotlight. "I just want to live my
life", he says. For the third time this morning, John is calling for his mother.
In his bedroom, she dresses him. "I just don't think John realises what he's
facing", she says, after he has left for school. "He doesn't stop to think that
he's totally dependent". As John is first to admit, he has yet to fully absorb
the impact of his disability. "I kind of just ignore the psychological stuff",
he says with a laugh. "I just keep busy, don't think about it". Instead, he
concentrates on what is most important to him: friends, graduation, and his new
car.
