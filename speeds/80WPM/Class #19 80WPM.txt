The Comeback Kid
It is 8:30 a.m. a week before graduation, and John, still half asleep, swings
his legs out of bed. On his arms are the supportive splints he wears, even when
he sleeps. "I toss and turn a lot", he explains, "I feel better with my arms
protected". Preparing breakfast in the kitchen, his mother Karen hears John
moving, and is already halfway down the hall when he calls out. It's a reality
John prefers not to dwell on. But, he is absolutely dependent on his mother's
care. Using the strength in his shoulders, John can lift both arms over his
head. He has no useful elbow movement, however, and no hand or wrist control.
Dr. van Beek is hopeful that John will regain feeling in his hands within two
years, but it may well take five years, and several more operations, as well as
intensive therapy, before anyone can know the extent to which John will be able
to move and control his hands. One of van Beek's goals now is to increase John's
elbow movement, but that, too, will require surgery, and long hours of therapy.
In the bathroom next to John's room, Karen attaches a strap just above the wrist
of his left splint. Then, she slides in a hook that John uses to pull his boxer
shorts up and down. A few minutes later, John calls "Mom" again, and within
seconds, Karen is undoing the hook, and replacing it with a second contraption
that holds John's toothbrush. She squeezes on a dab of toothpaste, and closes
the door behind her. "He doesn't like people to watch", says Karen, "I guess I
don't blame him". Privacy, these days, is a rarity for John. He has become
something of a public figure. At a welcome home pot luck dinner held in early
March, days after he returned from the hospital, the tired, weak, teenager took
time to chat with nearly each of the 300 friends and neighbours who packed the
Hurstfield Community Center. "I'm doing great", he repeated between mouthfuls of
baked beans and Jell-o. He has met scores of celebrities, who have visited him
in the hospital. And even had offers to audition as a singer, which is his
lifelong dream, from two recording studios. Says John, "I've never been treated
better", and yet, at times, he tires of the spotlight. "I just want to live my
life", he says. For the third time this morning, John is calling for his mother.
In his bedroom, she dresses him. "I just don't think John realises what he's
facing", she says, after he has left for school. "He doesn't stop to think that
he's totally dependent". As John is first to admit, he has yet to fully absorb
the impact of his disability. "I kind of just ignore the psychological stuff",
he says with a laugh. "I just keep busy, don't think about it". Instead, he
concentrates on what is most important to him: friends, graduation, and his new
car. Speeding down a gravel road, he changes the subject, with a mischievous
grin. "I had sort of a bad reputation before the accident", he says, "I wasn't
that grade A student, and people thought I drove too fast. The little old ladies
in town would shake their fingers at me when I drove by". "Now", he said, "they
pat me on the head". It is a plan his school pals are, for the most part, happy
to aid and abet. He walks among his friends with an air of boyish bravado,
laughing, talking, playing pranks like pushing the girls into a cluster of
shrubs, or nudging his new girlfriend, Shayla Cost, 17, to the edge of her
chair. As best they can, his friends try to make him comfortable. Darnell
Bushmiller, 18, a popular senior who became close to John after the accident, is
careful not to push John too hard. "I don't want to get in John's way, but I
want to help if he needs it. A lot of guys would be embarrassed to be seen
feeding another guy", he adds, "but it doesn't bother me, and it doesn't bother
John". Not a words is spoken about the splints discreetly tucked beneath John's
favourite sweatshirts. "We figure John doesn't want to talk about his problems",
says Kim Fike, 17, a junior, "I'm sure it must be worrying him, what his future
holds, but he never lets on. Not in public, at least". There are moments,
though, when all of this falls away. During rehearsal for the school talent
show, two of John's friends were singing "Meet me in Montana", a duet about
failed dreams, when suddenly, he recalls, he was overcome by sadness. "I don't
even like the song", he says, "but I almost started crying. I went down to the
locker room at the gym, and just sat there. I thought, "what am I doing? What am
I trying to prove?".

premeditate, revenge, degree, arouse, quarrel, homicide, abetter, reflection,
intentional, passion, manslaughter, disposition, felonious, provocation, rashly,
murder, deliberation, offense

The court is going to instruct you that to reduce an intentional felonious
homicide from the offense of murder to manslaughter upon the ground of sudden
quarrel, or heat of passion, the provocation must be of such character and
degree that would naturally excite and arouse passion. The term "heat of
passion" is defined for you as follows: such passion as naturally would be
aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition in
the same or similar circumstances as those in question, and such as would cause
him to act rashly without reflection and deliberation and from passion, rather
than judgment. With that instruction, means is that the defendant cannot set up
his own standard. If he is a quick tempered person, and there is some form of
provocation that leads him to believe that self defense is necessary, it is not
his standard that we judge it by. We judge it by what an ordinarily reasonable
person would do in the same situation. The court will tell you that if there was
a provocation that was of a nature not calculated to naturally arouse such
passion, if an unlawful killing of a human being follows such a provocation and
has all the elements of murder, then the mere fact of slight or remote
provocation will not reduce the offense to manslaughter. What was argued to you
was that Oscar Mullen reached for the knife, and suddenly he felt threatened by
it. This is provocation on the part of Bruce Nixon, and because of Oscar
Mullen's reaction to this, there is a sudden quarrel. A heat of passion takes
over. Mullen didn't premeditate and deliberate. He can't be guilty of murder.
Therefore, Harley Bennett cannot be guilty of murder as an aider and abetter
under these theories. It is our contention that obviously there was no heat of
passion. There may have been a distinct pattern of fear in the mind of Oscar
Mullen, but that is covered by the next instruction. Neither the emotion of fear
of itself, nor the emotion of revenge of itself toward others constitute the
heat of passion referred to in the law. You can have a combination of all of
them, and you can have that or any one of them, but the court tells you that any
one or more of them, meaning fear or revenge may exist in the mind of a person
who acts deliberately.

Don't Sweat The Small Stuff
While many of us frequently do nice things for others, we are almost certain to
mention our acts of kindness to someone else, secretly seeking their approval.
When we share our own niceness or generosity with someone else, it makes us feel
like we are thoughtful people. It reminds us of how nice we are, and how
deserving we are of kindness. While all acts of kindness are inherently
wonderful, there is something even more magical about doing something
thoughtful, but mentioning to no one ever. You always feel good when you give to
others than diluting the positive feelings by telling others about your own
kindness by keeping it to yourself. You get to retain all the positive feelings.
It's really true that one should give for the sake of giving, not to receive
something in return. This is precisely what you are doing when you don't mention
your kindness to others. Your rewards are the feelings that come from the act of
giving. The next time you do something really nice for someone else, keep it to
yourself, and revel in the abundant joy in giving.
