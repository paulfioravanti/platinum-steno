Who Moved My Cheese?
Haw just shook his head in disbelief. He, too, had counted on finding cheese at
Cheese Station C. He stood there for a long time, frozen in shock. He was just
not ready for this. Hem was yelling something, but Haw didn't want to hear it.
He didn't want to deal with what was facing him, so he just turned and tuned
everything out. The little people's behaviour was not very attractive or
productive, but it was understandable. Finding cheese wasn't easy, and it meant
a great deal more to the little people than just having enough of it to eat
every day. Finding cheese was the little people's way of getting what they
thought they needed to be happy. They had their own ideas of what cheese meant
to them, depending on their taste. For some, finding cheese was having material
things. For others, it was enjoying good health, or developing a spiritual sense
of well being. For Haw, cheese just meant feeling safe, having a loving family
some day, and living in a cozy cottage on Cheddar Lane. To him, cheese was
becoming a big cheese in charge of others, and owning a big house, atop
Camembert Hill.

Bart Bell
Intent to cause the child to be secretly confined must be found as a fact before
you can find the defendant guilty of being a party to this action. You cannot
look into his mind to see his intent, but as I mentioned before, you may
determine it from all the facts in evidence concerning this crime. You may
consider his conduct or any statements he made to the police, which may help
define his state of mind. If you are satisfied that the prosecution has met it's
burden of proof, you should find the defendant guilty of being a party to the
crime of kidnapping. If you are not truly satisfied, you must find the defendant
not guilty. If you find Bart Bell guilty, you must answer one more question: did
Bart Bell commit this offense with the intent of demanding that the child's
parents pay money in order to obtain the return of the child? Before you may
answer this question "yes", the state must show you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Bart Bell committed this offense with the intent to collect a ransom. This
intent must be proven. If it is proven from his acts and his words, bearing on
his intent.

Who Moved My Cheese?
Because cheese was important to them, the two little people spent a long time
trying to decide what to do. All they could think of was to keep looking around
Cheese Station C to see if the cheese was really gone. While Sniff and Scurry
had quickly moved on, Hem and Haw continued to hem and haw. They ranted and
raved at the injustice of it all. Haw started to get depressed. What would
happen if the cheese wasn't there tomorrow? He had made future plans based on
this cheese. The little people couldn't believe it. How could this have
happened? No one had warned them. It wasn't right. It was not the way things
were supposed to be. Hem and Haw went home that night, hungry and discouraged.
But, before they left, Haw wrote on the wall. The more important your cheese is
to you, the more you want to hold on to it. The next day, Hem and Haw left their
homes and returned to Cheese Station C again, where they still expected to
somehow find their cheese.

Negligence is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent person would not
do. It can mean the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person
would do. You must examine the circumstances, and determine whether these
circumstances were similar to those shown by the evidence. You must determine
whether this applies to the defendant. You must determine whether the defendant
acted in a way that was negligent, or whether the defendant acted in a way that
only was a part of the negligence that was involved. Liability may be on both
sides. For this reason, the liability of both parties must be considered. You
must consider the liability of the plaintiff as well. You must consider whether
the plaintiff acted in any way that would show that he also did a part in
causing the accident to happen. You must determine whether the defendant
exercised due care. You must consider the question of due care. Due care is the
reasonable amount of care that a person would exercise under a given set of
circumstances.
