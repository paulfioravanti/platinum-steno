The Comeback Kid
In the mint green therapy room at the hospital in Harvey, 20 miles away, John
sits patiently as his physical therapist Kelly Christiansen removes his
sweatshirt while John's father, Larry, chats about farm conditions. Making the
biweekly sessions is not easy for John's parents. Their married daughter, Kim
Blotter, lives away from home in Fargo, and their older son, Mick, 22, is a
truck driver who can pitch in on the farm only once or twice a week. With John
out of commission, Larry and Karen, who also drive the local school bus route
every day, are doing double duty just to get by. Still, they want to be by
John's side when they can. Larry was upset that old equipment without modern
safety devices hurt his son so terribly. "But", he says, "guilt, and going over
the past doesn't get you anything". John knows it was an accident. Pulling
John's fingers, Christiansen says "They're feeling good, John". "Yes, I know",
he responds. "Doctor Van Beak's almost sure I will get the feeling back", though
there is some discomfort as Kelly rotates John's arms, he feels no pain. "We're
keeping things stretched out as much as possible, so you will have muscles to
work with when the nerves come back". Though John's nerves are healing well, the
bones are not mending satisfactorily, and bone grafting must be performed. To
accommodate his senior year activities, the doctor agreed to schedule the
operation for later May. But when, early in May, a nurse from the office leaves
a message saying John is scheduled for surgery on May 23rd, John gets testy.
"I'm not going", he says, "I want to be here with my friends". Softly, Karen
says "you have to go". But, he is adamant, "oh no, I don't", he said, "this is
my body". Van Beak is not a man John crosses lightly. By the following day, he
has mellowed. "I'm so scared about the surgery", he says, "I'm scared of the
pain". At times like these, his trust in Dr. Van Beak is a source of great
comfort. A former North Dakota farm boy, who himself was injured in a tractor
accident, the microsurgeon shares a special bond with his patient. "Everybody
says I'm the hero", John likes to say, "but my doctor is the one who put me back
together". On his first return visit, John brought the surgeon a gift: a
handmade wooden calendar. There is something on the back. Van Beak saw the
neatly penned words, written by Karen at John's direction. "I think somebody
else better read this, or I'll cry". Karen took the calendar: "to my hero", she
read, "from your favourite and most famous patient. John Thompson". Touched by
the courage of John, Van Beak has become more than just his doctor. Responding
to John's worries about what to do with his donated money, Van Beak referred the
family to a money manager. He gently, but firmly, pushes John to enroll in
college in the fall. "Fame is fleeting, John. One day the cameras will be gone,
and you will be alone". As fond as he is of his most famous patient, Van Beak is
concerned about John's flirtation with stardom. "Right now", he says, "John is
in denial with all the attention and excitement, he hasn't come to terms with
the fact that he lost something very important". Years from now, John may regain
some use of his hands, but until them, he has to learn to function more fully on
his own, using a feeding device, for example, instead of being fed. "Your mom is
doing super human duties", he tells him, "that can't go on forever". This
summer, when John will spend six weeks doing rehab therapy at the Courage
Center, near Minneapolis, reality will hit, his doctor predicts.
