The Comeback Kid
In the mint green therapy room at the hospital in Harvey, 20 miles away, John
sits patiently as his physical therapist Kelly Christiansen removes his
sweatshirt while John's father, Larry, chats about farm conditions. Making the
biweekly sessions is not easy for John's parents. Their married daughter, Kim
Blotter, lives away from home in Fargo, and their older son, Mick, 22, is a
truck driver who can pitch in on the farm only once or twice a week. With John
out of commission, Larry and Karen, who also drive the local school bus route
every day, are doing double duty just to get by.
