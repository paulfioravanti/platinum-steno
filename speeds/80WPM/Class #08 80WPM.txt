Contributory Negligence
The burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff to prove by the preponderance of
evidence that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and if on this
question you find the evidence evenly balanced or preponderating in plaintiff's
favour, then you will find that the plaintiff was not negligent.

Definition of Proximate Cause
Proximate Cause is sometimes defined as the direct or immediate cause of the
accident. An alleged negligent act or omission is a approximate cause of an
accident or injury where such act or omission is a substantial factor causing
the accident. If a person has no reasonable ground to expect or anticipate that
a particular act would, or might, result in any injury to anybody, then of
course the act would not be negligent at all, and no liability could result by
reason of such act or omission. But, on the other hand, if the act is one that
the party ought, in the exercise of ordinary care, to have anticipated was
liable to result in injuries to others, then he is liable for any injury
proximately resulting from it, although he could not have anticipated the
particular injury that did happen. Consequences which follow in unbroken
sequence without an intervening efficient cause from the original negligent act
are natural and proximate. And for such consequences, the original wrongdoer is
responsible, even though he could not have foreseen the particular results which
did follow.

We are taught realtime theories, and how to work with wonderful CAT software, on
powerful computers with steno writers. What court reporters need to do their
jobs has transformed court reporting schools, and how court reporters work.
Perhaps the key to expanding and growing skill sets as students, court
reporters, instructors, CART providers, and captioners, is to know that our
journey is dedicated to a gateway where we preserve the instant spoken word. How
you interact with the gateway, with your expectations, may be a matter of simply
refocusing your focus. Many court reporters are nearing retirement, and this
will open new markets for individuals who are intent on the opportunities. It is
an opportunity for every court reporter to expand on current strengths.

Who Moved My Cheese
His old thinking had been clouded by his worries and fears. He used to think
about not having enough cheese or not having it last as long as he wanted. He
used to think more about what could go wrong than what could go right. But, that
had changed in the days since he had left Cheese Station C. He used to believe
that cheese should never be moved, and that change wasn't right. Now, he
realised it was natural for change to continually occur, whether you expect it
or not. Change could surprise you only if you didn't expect it, and weren't
looking for it. When he realised he had changed his beliefs, he paused to write
on the wall. Old beliefs do not lead you to new cheese. Haw had not found any
new cheese yet, but as he ran through the maze, he thought about what he had
already learned.

The Authority of an Agent
The powers of agents are limited. Generally speaking, when an agent is appointed
for a particular purpose, and is authorised to perform certain acts, the
liability of the principal for such acts depends first upon the power actually
conferred, second the power reasonably necessary for the execution of those
powers which are actually conferred, third the powers annexed by custom or
usage, that is such powers as the agent was accustomed to exercise for the
company, and permitted to exercise for it, and fourth, the powers, in addition,
thereto, which the principal, by his words or conduct, would lead third persons
to believe that the agent possesses. The agent has implied authority to do
whatever is reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. It arises
out of the authority expressly conferred. A principal is presumed to have
conferred all auxiliary authority reasonably necessary to make the express
authority effective.

As you discover the specifics in your private and professional world, you will
then be able to make choices to propel you to organise your fears. Perhaps we
are struggling too hard. Perhaps we want to know more about our fears. I believe
that organising fears is a powerful step to moving toward your distinctive
goals, whether it is being able to read accurate notes in school, to transcribe
a test, whether it is to train yourself for a better working position or to
follow your heart's desire with a new path that you create. Fear can be a
motivator. Setbacks can be a motivator, too. We know this because each day we
are required to earn a 95 percent accuracy while in school. We know this with
the required accuracy on each job.

Who Moved My Cheese
Haw hadn't found any cheese yet, but as he ran through the maze, he thought
about what he had already learned. Haw now realised that his new beliefs were
encouraging new behaviours. He was behaving differently than when he kept
returning to the same cheeseless station. He knew when you change what you
believe, you change what you do. You can believe that a change will harm you and
resist it. Or, you can believe that finding new cheese will help you to embrace
the change. It all depends on what you choose to believe.
