We plan to go to the mountains for the weekend. Are there very many rentals
available in the area. Maybe I can make reservations in advance. If I could have
your lodging directory, I can check what is available. When is the lake open to
the public? It would have been nice if you could have taken the trip, too.

Brian brought a loaf of bread. The brown brushes belong to Brett. On Tuesday,
are we meeting for breakfast or brunch? The British fleet sails for Britain on
Wednesday. The bracelet and the bracket are made of brass. We drove the car to
the end of the driveway. Sam dragged the drum to the dump. Sally dreamed about
the dress. Ellen dropped the drink on the drill. The druggist sent his drip-dry
jacket to the dry cleaners. The dreadful drizzle continued to cause the boat to
drift. The coach will reach a decision on Friday. Was the hitching post one inch
above the branch? For lunch, we had a sandwich and a bunch of grapes. The quiche
was much too rich. The witch watched the man attach the chain to the latch. The
matches belonged to Mitch.

Don't Sweat The Small Stuff
Don't interrupt others, or finish their sentences.
It wasn't until a few years ago that I realised how often I interrupted others
and/or finished their sentences. Shortly thereafter, I also realised how
destructive this habit was. Not only to the respect and love I received from
others, but also for the tremendous amount of energy it takes to try to be in
two heads at once. Think about it for a moment. When you hurry someone along,
interrupt someone, or finish his or her sentence, you have to keep track not
only of your own thoughts, but of the person you are interrupting as well. This
tendency, which, by the way, is extremely common in busy people, encourages both
parties to speed up their speech and their thinking. This, in turn, makes both
people nervous, irritable, and annoyed. It's downright exhausting. It's also the
cause of many arguments because if there's one thing almost everyone resents,
it's someone who doesn't listen to what they are saying. And how can you really
listen to what someone is saying when you are speaking for that person. Once you
begin noticing yourself interrupting others, you'll see that this insidious
tendency is nothing more than an innocent habit that has become invisible to
you. This is good news because it means that all you really have to do is to
begin catching yourself when you forget. Remind yourself before a conversation
begins, if possible, to be patient, and wait. Tell yourself to allow the other
person to finish speaking before you take your turn. You'll notice right away
how much the interactions with the people in your life will improve as a direct
result of this simple act. The people you communicate with will feel much more
relaxed around you when they feel heard and listened to. You'll also notice how
much more relaxed you will feel when you stop interrupting others. Your heart
and pulse rates will slow down, and you'll begin to enjoy your conversations,
rather than rush through them. This is an easy way to become a more relaxed,
loving person.

illegal, criminal, rightful, robbery, property, intention, admission,
confession, larceny, denial, voluntary, possession, ownership, defense,
accusation

The illegal taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with no
intention of returning the property to its rightful owner is called larceny.
Robbery is the taking of the property in the presence of its owner with no
intention of returning it. Ownership is legal title to property. Possession is
the physical control of property. Criminal intent is necessary for a person to
be found guilty of a crime. A confession is a voluntary statement offered by a
person admitting involvement in a crime. An admission is not a confession.
Defense is the denial of the accusation.

Never Turn Your Back: Don't Fool With Mother Nature. A Moment's Carelessness Can
Cost You Your Life
Americans have always had an ambivalent attitude toward the out of doors. The
earliest settlers viewed the wilderness as a kind of savage beast that had to be
beaten back and subdued. Today, we lap up reports of bear attacks, snake bites,
violent weather, and natural disasters. We still fear the forces of nature. I
think that much of our fear is misplaced. As a sportsman for thirty-plus years,
and a survivor of some very close scrapes, it is not the wild world I fear, but,
rather, my own temerity. One of my first lessons in humility occurred on the
Delaware River when I was a teenager. My companions and I were fishing on a
sunny May day from a canoe, on a deceptively smooth drift that brought us close
to an inviting tree-lined bank. We all grabbed our rods and concentrated on the
fish, rather than on where the canoe was going. Suddenly, a tree limb appeared
at chest level. Instinctively, foolishly, the three of us grabbed for it. The
current swept the canoe out from under us, leaving us clinging to the limb, neck
deep in icy water. I can still remember how frighteningly powerful the water
was. How it tugged and tore at us, trying to break our hold on that tree. We
made it to shore, hand over handing the length of the limb. When we found the
canoe, it was wrapped around a rock. We needed a block and tackle to pry it free
of the river's strong grip. Although I have since made it a practice always to
have someone on the oars, or a paddle when floating any river in any kind of
boat. Lapses in judgment that turn into big trouble can take many other forms. I
was once surf casting on Mexico's West Coast. The surf was up. It wasn't angry
water, just fine. Breaking waves that had lured a school of fish close to shore
to feed on the mullet in the wave wash. I was getting nearly a strike per cast,
and had just lost a big yellowfin corvina that broke off. Taking my lure, I was
too excited to waste time wading back to shore to tie on a new lure. Instead, I
simply turned my back to the surf, clamped my rod butt between my knees, and
knotted a new lure to my line right there. The wave that hit me was bigger that
any I had seen that afternoon. It slammed me into the sand, and rolled me like a
ragdoll toward the beach. Then, it began to drag me seaward, as my waders
ballooned in the undertow. While the huge wave retreated from the beach, it
sucked enough water back to sea, so that I could find my footing, and stand in
thigh-deep water. The weight of the water in my waders anchored my feet to the
sand. Once the strong undertow subsided, I managed to go back up on to the
beach. Another failure to recognise potential disaster almost cost me my wife.
We were hunting for broadbills in the great south bay off Long Island, New York,
a form of waterfowling, where you shoot over decoys from a low profile boat, a
scooter anchored well off shore. The best hunting takes place during bitter cold
weather, when the bays ice up. Pockets of ice-free water open up in the mantle
of ice, and broadbills are drawn to them like chickens to cracked corn. Because
it is such a cold sport, it is customary for one person to man the scooter while
the other keeps warm in a nearby car. I'd just done my turn in the rig, and as
we changed places in the tender, I told Jen that I would run to town for some
hot soup and coffee. It was a sunny, calm day, with temperatures in the low 20s.
Every sign pointed toward stable ice, but when I returned 10 minutes later,
my knees buckled. Inexplicably, the ice had broken loose from the shore, and was
drifting toward Fire Island, some four miles away. The scooter, decoys, and Jen
were caught up in its leading edge. Although the scooter was equipped with oars,
Jen found that rowing into the ice sheet was impossible. She tried to break ice
in front of the bow, then paddle a few feet forward, but the oncoming ice would
meet the boat before it made any headway. I jumped into the tender, and held my
breath. I had no idea if the 5 horse outboard had enough power to break a path
to the scooter, or, enough reserve to get us both back to shore. The motor
raced, kicking up a rooster tail of spray. The boat inched forward, the soft
salt ice buckling under it. I got a line to the scooter, bid farewell to the
decoys, and kissed both the sand and Jen when we got ashore. People don't
deliberately set out to freeze or drown, or slide off steep trails, but things
happen all the time. Every autumn there are stories of sportsmen who leave home
unprepared for sudden changes in the weather, and fall victim to exposure. Every
spring and summer, easily avoidable boating accidents claim lives, and fishermen
are swept away from a combination of currents, and slippery rocks, and a
moment's carelessness. Does this mean we should fear the outdoors? Of course
not, but it does mean we should never fail to respect it. If we always keep in
mind the human capacity to get into trouble by failing to think ahead, we will
never, through arrogance, turn our backs on nature's awesome potential.
