So many of us live our lives as if the secret purpose is to somehow get
everything done. We stay up late, get up early, avoid having fun, and keep our
loved ones waiting. Sadly, I've seen many people put off their loved ones so
long, that the loved ones lose interest in maintaining the relationship. I used
to do this myself. Often, we convince ourselves that our obsession with our to
do list is only temporary. That once we get through the list, we'll be calm,
relaxed, and happy. But in reality, this rarely happens. As items are checked
off, new ones simply replace them. The nature of your inbasket is that its meant
to have items to be completed in it. It's not meant to be empty. There will
always be phone calls that need to be made, projects to complete, and work to be
done. In fact, it can be argued that a full inbasket is essential for success.
It means your time is in demand. Regardless of who you are, or what you do,
however, remember that nothing is more important than your own sense of
happiness and inner peace, and that of your loved ones. If you're obsessed with
getting everything done, you'll never have a sense of well being. In reality,
almost everything can wait. Very little in our work lives truly falls into the
emergency category. If you stay focused on your work, it will get done in due
time. I find that if I remind myself frequently that the purpose of life isn't
to get it all done, but to enjoy each step along the way, and live a life filled
with love, it's far easier to control my obsession with completing my list of
things to do. Remember, when you die there will still be unfinished business to
take care of. And you know what? Someone else will do it for you. Don't waste
any more precious moments of your life regretting the inevitable.

inter vivos, quid pro quo, voir dire, curriculum vitae

A transaction between living persons is referred to as inter vivos. An
inter vivos trust is a legal document creating rights among individuals prior to
the death of any one of them. An inter vivos trust differs from a testamentary
trust. Quid pro quo means "what for what", or "something for something", an
early form of the concept of a consideration in a contract is referred to as a
quid pro quo. The French term "voir dire" means "to speak the truth". A voir
dire examination of a juror is conducted to determine a person's qualification
to serve on a jury. "Curriculum vitae" literally means "the course of one's
life", frequently shortened to CV. A curriculum vitae is a written account of
one's person history in a resume format.

tavern, on the other hand, Miranda rights, officer, in addition, inference

It spelled out the alleged crimes, and referred to facts that led to a
conviction on the theory of party to a crime. These facts were the same ones
that were introduced at trial. The defendant's version of the incident is that
he was too intoxicated to form an intent to commit a crime, and too intoxicated
to know what was going on. He said that he drank a quart of brandy early in the
day, followed by several bottles of beer at various locations. He also said that
he took part in the smoking of several marijuana cigarettes. He said that he and
the other participants went to a bar. He maintains that while they were there,
he drank at least four glasses of beer, and two water glasses full of straight
whiskey. Although he testified that he recalled being at the bar, he claimed to
remember none of the later events of the evening. At the trial, his version of
his drunken state was backed up by several of the other parties. On the other
hand, his version was sharply disputed by the arresting officer, who stated that
he read the Miranda rights to Paul Cross, after Paul Cross asked why he had not
been read his rights. This would show an awareness of what was happening. The
over also said that although it seemed that Paul Cross had been drinking, it did
not appear that he was drunk. The officer did not see anything out of the
ordinary about the way Paul Cross walked. Another officer who was with the
defendant for about a half hour during the booking process, said that he did not
think Mr. Cross was drunk. He stated that he did not smell anything on his
breath, and he stated that Mr. Cross was able to walk and to carry on a coherent
conversation without slurring his speech. Moreover, the state impeached his
credibility. He said that until he was in court, he did not know of a statement
made to the police by another party with regard to his conduct at the scene.

drought, prediction, technology, atmosphere, weather, meteorologist, phenomenon,
meteorology, vulnerable, forecast, fluctuation, science, troposphere

One of the most important factors influencing the environment is the weather.
People have had to cope with the fluctuations of weather patterns for centuries.
With all of the advancements in technology, we still find ourselves as
vulnerable as ever to rain, sleet, snow, hail, and drought. The science that
deals with the study of weather is known as meteorology. The weather phenomenon
that takes place in a relatively small portion of the atmosphere, which extends
six to ten miles above the earth. This area is called troposphere. The air in
the troposphere is in constant movement, which explains the changes in the
weather patterns. Meteorologists have learned much about the weather and its
cycles. We do not hesitate to make predictions and forecasts, but all too often
the factors affecting a weather forecast can change dramatically, making any
prediction totally inaccurate.

arson, forgery, malicious, consummation, falsification, bribery, assault,
battery, defraud, penalty, burglary

Arson is the malicious and willful burning of property. Most states provide a
severe penalty when arson is committed, and lives are threatened, and assault is
a threat to an individual to inflict bodily harm or injury. Battery is the
actual consummation of the threat. Bribery is the exchange of anything of value
in order to influence a decision or act. Bribery is considered a misdemeanor. In
most states, burglary is the crime of breaking and entering with the intent to
commit a felony. Forgery is the alteration or falsification of a written
instrument with the clear intent to defraud.
