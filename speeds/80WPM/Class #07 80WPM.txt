The principal question in this case is whether or not the fire started by any
act, design, or procurement on the part of the plaintiff, or through any act
done or suffered by his privity, or with his consent. In deciding this question,
you should take into account every act, fact, and incident connected with the
fire and subsequent transactions as detailed in the evidence. However, if you
have heard any evidence in this case which the court, afterwards, struck out,
you are to wholly disregard such evidence in arriving at your verdict. In giving
these instructions, it is the intention of the court simply to instruct the jury
as to the law applicable to the case, but it is not the intention of the court
in the least degree to give the jury any opinion as to whether or not the
defendant is guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, or to express any
opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of the testimony or as to the
credibility of any witness.

He entered the cheese station with great excitement, but to his dismay, he found
it was empty. Someone had already been there, and had left only the few bits of
new cheese. He realised that if he had moved sooner, he would have very likely
found a good deal of new cheese here. Haw decided to go back and see if Hem was
ready to join him. As he retraced his steps, he stopped and wrote on the wall.
The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese. After a
while, Haw made his way back to cheese station C and found Hem. He offered Hem
bits of new cheese, but was turned down. Hem appreciated his new friend's
gesture, but said "I don't think I would like new cheese. It's not what I'm used
to. I want my own cheese back, and I'm not going to change until I get what I
want".

Toughest Part: Words and Fears
A student now in the 225 class is scared to death of passing the state test.
"Then people will see that I can't write accurately. I changed almost everything
to briefs to pass my tests. I read through all my errors on each test, and I
learned a realtime theory." A student in a 180 class recently enrolled in a 100
words per-minute class to learn how to really write and how to pass tests. "And
my family is not happy. Not at all. Yet, I know what I have to do." One court
reporter, now in court, was called into the manager's office while reporting a
jury trial and was told she must become certified immediately or she would lose
her job. The reporter then asked me "I'll have to join NCRA now, right?". I
listen to each with great respect. Each person has unique challenges. Each
person also has the opportunity to excel in a way that will serve immediate
goals as well as long term goals. In addition, each person is tackling goals
that also serve our profession. One of my favourite comments was shared by a
person sharing her frustrations after receiving the results of an exam. The
reporter said "the toughest part is the words. It's that simple." This is the
same court reporter who, while working to pass the RPR, then CCP, and then CRR,
asked me each time "what should I work on? Should I just read the dictionary?"

Highway Traffic Act
Members of the jury, each party in this case charges the other with violating
certain statutes of the Highway Traffic Act. It is the law of this state that a
violation of any of the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act by a person
operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway shall be prima facie evidence of
negligence. This presumption, however, may be rebutted by evidence showing that
the statute in question was not violated or, by evidence, showing a reasonable
ground for such violation. The driver of a motor vehicle, whose vision is
blocked by snow and wind, or other conditions, must exercise care and caution,
such as with the situation. The factors to be considered when determining a
driver's negligence are the speed and control of the vehicle, the extent of
visibility, and the degree of care and caution required under the circumstances.

Who Moved My Cheese
Haw just shook his head in disappointment and sadly went back out on his own. As
he returned to the farthest point he had reached in the maze, he missed his
friend, but realised he liked what he was discovering. Even before he found what
he hoped would be a great supply of new cheese, if ever he knew that what made
him happy wasn't just having cheese. He was happy when he wasn't being run by
his fear. He liked what he was doing now. Knowing this, Haw didn't feel as weak
as he did when he stayed in cheese station C with no cheese. Just realising that
he was not letting his fear stop him, and knowing that he had taken a new
direction, nourished him and gave him strength.
