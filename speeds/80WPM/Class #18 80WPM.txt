We are sending this email to see when you will be able to send your manuscript.
If you are having problems, let us know. We haven't heard from your co-author.
Have you? Is he still working on chapters 10 through 35? He had only completed
three chapters when we last spoke with him. There is so much writing to do that
we are very concerned. If you have any time, please contact your editors. They
had hoped to hear from you before September 23rd.

caveat emptor, caveat venditor, de facto, de jure

Caveat emptor means "let the buyer beware". When a person buys a product at his
own risk, caveat emptor applies. In caveat venditor, the purchaser must be
protected from buying SPHAEUBS mistakes made by the seller. Caveat venditor
means "let the seller beware". De facto means "existing in fact", as
distinguished from "existing in right". A de facto corporation exists in fact,
but has not met all the requirements of the law. To be in total compliance with
the law in all respects, is to be de jure. De jure means "valid or legitment".
Caveat emptor may be subject to modification when a warranty is involved. A
de facto corporation is not a legal entity.

For over 200 years, the railroads have played an integral part in the movement
of the United States. In 1804, the first steam locomotive that ran on rails was
developed. The first American railway to be used was the Delaware and Hudson
Canal Company Railroad. This pioneer railroad was used to haul coal. In 1830,
the first daily train service operated on the South Carolina Railroad. From
these early beginnings, expansion was rapid. Railroads were used to haul freight
and passengers. After the Civil War in 1869, railroad tracks were built westward
from Omaha, Nebraska, and eastward from Sacramento, California. The tracks were
united at Promontory, Utah. Railroad expansion has continued to grow since that
time. With the development of modern steam locomotives, the railroad can provide
a fast and inexpensive mode of transportation.

However, the state introduced a letter that he had written while he was in jail,
in which he referred to the other party's statement. The statement itself tends
to show that Paul Cross was aware of what was going on. In addition, there was
evidence that he received some of the stolen money. The defendant's intent may
be inferred from his conduct, and a fair inference of criminal intent can be
raised from his statement. To be sure, much of the evidence in this case was
indirect, but this kind of evidence may be enough to support a conviction. The
trier of the facts may not indulge in conclusions that are unsupported by any
evidence, but the facts in this case show not only a verbal act of aiding in the
commission of the crime, but also the physical act in sharing in the proceeds of
the crime. The trial judge could disbelieve Paul Cross's version. The facts in
this case were sufficient to support a conviction on the theory of party to a
crime. Paul Cross's claim of innocence is not consistent with the facts that the
trial judge was entitled to believe.

His arms were severed in a terrible farm accident, John Thompson saved his own
life. Now overcoming fear and pain, he's learning how to live it again.

In his family's modest North Dakota farmhouse, John Thompson wanders from the
kitchen to the living room and back, his tiny toy poodle, Tinker, barking
playfully at his feet. "You think you're real cute, don't you?", John says, with
a laugh. Then, coaxing the dog on to his lap, his arms hanging rigid at his
sides, John uses a knee to lift Tinker up to his face. Rubbing his nose in the
poodle's soft fur, he says quietly "It's the only way I can feel him". That John
can feel Tinker at all is, by all accounts, a mere miracle. Four months ago, he
survived a nightmarish accident in which both his arms were torn from his body.
The arms were reattached eight hours later, but John's ordeal was far from over.
Though doctors say that feeling will gradually return to his fingers, the
teenager lives with constant frustration because his fragile, slow healing arms
will not obey his will. He is beginning to come to terms with the physical and
psychological scars. Enduring the frustrations of rehab, and even testing the
subtle perils of sudden celebrity. Thus far, he has struggled with impressive
success. "The human soul needs heroes", says Dr. Alan Van Beak, John's surgeon,
"and John meets the bill". John's appointment with this all began about 11:30
a.m., on January 11th, when he was shoveling barley from his father's Ford
pickup, into the auger, a device commonly used on farms to use grain into
feeding bins. As he recalls, he jumped off the pickup, slipped on a patch of
ice, tripped on the auger, and fell on to the power take off, a swiftly rotating
shaft connected from a tractor to the auger. In a split second, the PTO tugged
one arm, then the other into its rapidly spinning blades, flinging John around
and around. "The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground", he says,
"I couldn't feel my left arm. I couldn't see my right arm. I went to pick myself
up and my arms were gone." Since his parents were in Bismarck, 90 miles away,
John knew no one could hear, even if he screamed. "I thought I was going to die,
and I didn't want to die". A cool head was his only hope for survival. He rushed
400 feet to the sliding glass door in the back of the house, tried in vein to
use the bone dangling from his left shoulder to nudge it open. And then, blood
oozing from the stumps of both arms, ran to the front door, kicked it open, and
made his way to his cell phone. Using a pen clenched in his teeth, he pecked out
his uncle's number, and asked his cousin to send for help. Finally, concerned
about getting blood on his mother's carpet, he walked to the bathroom, kicked
aside the shower curtain, and sank, crying, into the bathtub, where he waited
alone, but for the company of Tinker, until help arrived. By 6:30 p.m., an air
ambulance had delivered Thompson to North Memorial Medical Center, near
Minneapolis, where a micro surgery team reattached the limbs that John, despite
the loss of half his body's blood, had thought to remind the local ambulance
crew to retrieve. Then, as now, John dismisses any notion of heroism. "You do
what you have to do", he said at the time, propped in a hospital bed, with no
idea what the future might offer. "I'm trying to figure out how I'll finish high
school, if I can drive again". Today, less than three months after John returned
from hospital to his family's 1600 acre farm on the outskirts of Hurdsfield,
North Dakota, the 18-year-old high school senior has already found answers to
many of his questions. With the help of a specially equipped 2012 Honda Accord,
sold to him at cost by a local dealer, John can, in fact, drive again. With his
left hand secured in a customised steering device. Speeding along a road to
school, in the shiny black Accord, John marvels at the attention he's received,
and the money. Admirers have sent some $600,000 in donations for his future. His
medical bills are covered by the family's insurance. "My life is so much better
than it's ever been", he says, still reveling in his newfound fame. "It's hard
to explain, but there are more possibilities. The world seems more open to me."
Best of all, on May 17, he graduated with his classmates from Bowdon High
School.

The marriage relation between husband and wife is called matrimony. A valid
marriage is performed by an authorised public official. A common law marriage is
created when a man and woman co-habit as husband and wife. Palimony laws are in
existence in many states were common law marriages are no longer recognised.
Annulment treats a marriage as if it never existed. An agreement by a husband
and wife to live separately, and still remain married, is a separation. The
actual termination of a marriage by divorce is called a dissolution. Grounds for
divorce vary from state to state. Conciliation procedures are an attempt to
revolve marital conflicts. Alimony is the provision for support and maintenance
of a spouse.
