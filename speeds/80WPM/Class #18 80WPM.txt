When you will, be able, if you or you are, have you, there is, so much, we are,
if you have, from you

We are sending this email to see when you will be able to send your manuscript.
If you are having problems, let us know. We haven't heard from your co-author.
Have you? Is he still working on chapters 10 through 35? He had only completed
three chapters when we last spoke with him. There is so much writing to do that
we are very concerned. If you have any time, please contact your editors. They
had hoped to hear from you before September 23rd.
