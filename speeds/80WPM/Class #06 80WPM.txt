A new year can mean a fresh start for many people, and it is the reason that so
many people decide to make new years resolutions. Whether it's a personal or a
professional one, goals can make people look at their lives a little
differently, and consider potential alternatives to the way they do things
currently. But having goals is just the beginning. Two important, but overlooked
factors for goal making are assigning a value to each goal and following through
with a plan. The value is really about why the person thinks this is a good
goal. While many people often have the same kinds of goals, how many people
decide to lose weight every New Year's Day? Or, decide to look for a better job?
People have different reasons for deciding that goal. Let's take the example of
becoming more proficient with realtime. One person may want to become better at
realtime to be able to take on captioning jobs, while another person's realtime
goal is all about saving time. That's assigning a value to a goal, and
understanding it's value can keep many people motivated when the progress is
slow.

Common Carrier
Gentlemen of the jury, a common carrier is one who undertakes, for hire, to
transport from place to place the goods or persons of those who choose to employ
him. The defendant, in taking and transporting the machine here in question, was
a common carrier for hire. Generally, a common carrier of goods ensures the safe
transportation of goods committed to him for that purpose, and he is responsible
for all damages to the same while in transit. However, there are certain
exceptions to this rule. One of these exceptions is if the loss or damage arose
solely from the fault of the shipper himself. That is, if the goods or freight
transported is improperly packed, or improperly loaded by the shipper, and this
fact is not apparent or known to the carrier, and the carrier is not at fault
himself in causing the damage, then the carrier is not liable for the loss or
damage resulting from such improper loading by the shipper.

Who Moved My Cheese?
Haw looked down the dark passageway, and was aware of his fear. What lay ahead?
Was it empty, or worse, were there dangers lurking? He began to imagine all
kinds of frightening things that could happen to him. He was scaring himself to
death. Then, he laughed at himself. He realised his fears were making things
worse. So, he did what he would do if he wasn't afraid. He moved in a new
direction. As he started running down the dark hall, he began to smile. Haw
didn't realise it yet, but he was discovering what nourished his soul. He was
letting go and trusting what lay ahead for him, even though he did not know
exactly what it was. To his surprise, Haw started to enjoy himself more and
more. "Why do I feel so good?", he wandered, "I don't have any cheese and I
don't know where I am going". Before long, he knew why he felt good. He stopped
to write again on the wall. When you move beyond your fear, you feel free. Haw
realised that he had been held captive by his own fear. Moving in a new
direction had freed him.

It cannot be said, however, that the carrier must have known that the machine
was not, in fact, safely loaded. The shipper usually knows better than the
carrier the manner in which the goods have been packed, or loaded, and the
manner in which they should be packed or loaded, and even though the carrier may
have knowledge of some defect in the packing or loading, still, if it is not
apparent to the ordinary observation of the carrier that the goods cannot be
safely carried in the condition in which they are presented, the carrier should
not be held to take the chances of damage or injury from such improper packing
or loading. The burden of proof rests upon the defendant to prove by the
preponderance of the evidence that the loss or damage arose solely from the
improper loading by the defendant.

Great Things Never Come From Comfort Zones
It's also important to make a plan toward a goal and deadlines keep you
accountable for making progress. Many New Year's resolutions fail because a plan
is never put in place. To go back to the example of becoming more realtime
proficient, the person who is interested in taking on captioning jobs may decide
to sign up for certification tests, download practice dictation at the speeds
needed, and devote 15 minutes every day to practice. Another person may decide
that cleaning up his or her dictionary is a good first step to better realtime,
followed by getting support through a train group, and hiring a scopist to
further refine a dictionary and help speed processing transcripts. Both people
have mapped out a pathway to becoming realtime proficient, but the different
values they assign to the final goal will help them decide which steps to take.
Another important step to making goals stick is to anticipate obstacles, and
figure out ways to overcome them ahead of time. Things happen every day that can
cause us to not follow the plan we've set out for ourselves. For instance, if
part of the plan is to practice every day, what happens if you miss a day for
illness or travel or whenever reason. Maybe one person will decide that it's
important to practice no matter what, and decide that if the reason is one that
has to do with lack of a steno machine, that air steno practice is good enough
once in a while, that person may also make the next day's practice mandatory.
Someone else might decide that if they want to practice every day, they will do
it before anything else happens that day, making it harder for a change in
habits to derail the plan.
