The rights that are granted to everyone are the right to an attorney, the right
to a speedy and public jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, the right to
remain silent, and the right to produce evidence. Two of these rights have been
identified as being to important that a court decision set forth that they must
be disclosed to the individual who is being taken in for questions and possible
arrest. These two rights are the right against self-incrimination, and the right
to an attorney. If the rights are not read properly, the case may get thrown out
of court. Police officers take care in reading these rights to suspects to keep
it from being thrown out of court. The Miranda decision set forth that all
individuals must be told that these two rights are to help them get a fair
trial. All people must be informed of their rights accordingly. The decision was
important because it insured that people would get the protection that was given
to them under the constitution of the United States. When the Miranda decision
was handed down, it was designed to help even those people who were not aware of
the rights granted them under the constitution.

Haw picked up a small, sharp rock, and wrote a serious thought on the wall for
him to think about. As was his custom, Haw even drew a picture of cheese around
it, hoping it would help him to smile, lighten up, and go after new cheese. But,
Hem didn't want to see it. It read: "If you do not change, you can become
extinct". Then Haw stuck his head out and looked anxiously into the maze. He
thought about how he'd gotten himself into this cheese-less situation. He had
believed that there may not be any cheese in the maze, or he may not find it.
Such fearful beliefs were immobilising, and killing him. Haw smiled. He knew Hem
was wondering "who moved my cheese?", but Haw was wondering why didn't I get up
and move with the cheese sooner. As he started out into the maze, Haw looked
back to where he had come from, and felt its comfort. He could feel himself
being drawn back into familiar territory, even though he hadn't found cheese
there for some time.

assault and battery, felon, felony, arraignment
When a person commits the crime of assault and battery, the person is charged
with the crime. A person who has been charged with assault and battery is
charged with committing the crime of placing someone in fear of harm and in
actually touching the individual. There is a difference between the crime of
assault and the crime of battery. The crime of assault may occur when someone
does not actually harm the individual. Placing anyone in the position of placing
them in fear of being harmed is enough to be considered assault. The person who
actually touches the other person when placing them in fear of being harmed is
also guilty of the crime known as battery. Often a person is charged with two
crimes at the same time. If a person is convicted of a crime that is considered
a felony, the person is considered to be a felon. A person who has committed a
felony will be sent to a state prison. A person who has been charged with the
crime of assault and battery will be acquitted if the jury finds that the person
is not guilty of the charge. When a person is charged with a crime, that person
has the right to an arraignment. And arraignment is a hearing. At the
arraignment, a person has the right to make a plea. At the time of the plea, the
person may have bail set. If he can meet the financial amount of bail, he may be
set free until the trial. He will pay the bail, which is the amount paid to
promise that he will appear in court. The person who loans the money for bail
and charges a percentage is called a bail bondsman. The charge of assault and
battery results in the person having to have a criminal trial.
