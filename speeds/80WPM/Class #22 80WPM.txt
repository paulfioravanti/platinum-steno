The rights that are granted to everyone are the right to an attorney, the right
to a speedy and public jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, the right to
remain silent, and the right to produce evidence. Two of these rights have been
identified as being to important that a court decision set forth that they must
be disclosed to the individual who is being taken in for questions and possible
arrest. These two rights are the right against self-incrimination, and the right
to an attorney. If the rights are not read properly, the case may get thrown out
of court. Police officers take care in reading these rights to suspects to keep
it from being thrown out of court. The Miranda decision set forth that all
individuals must be told that these two rights are to help them get a fair
trial. All people must be informed of their rights accordingly. The decision was
important because it insured that people would get the protection that was given
to them under the constitution of the United States. When the Miranda decision
was handed down, it was designed to help even those people who were not aware of
the rights granted them under the constitution.

Haw picked up a small, sharp rock, and wrote a serious thought on the wall for
him to think about. As was his custom, Haw even drew a picture of cheese around
it, hoping it would help him to smile, lighten up, and go after new cheese. But,
Hem didn't want to see it. It read: "If you do not change, you can become
extinct".
